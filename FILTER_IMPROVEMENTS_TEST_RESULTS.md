## Filter Logic Validation

### Balance Type Handling ✅
```javascript
// Customers: Dr = Debit (they owe you), Cr = Credit (you owe them)
const actualBalance = balanceType === 'Dr' ? -Math.abs(balance) : Math.abs(balance);
✅ Correctly handles Dr/Cr balance types
✅ Proper sign conversion
✅ Accurate filtering results
```

### Stock Status Logic ✅
```javascript
// Products: In Stock (>0), Low Stock (0 < qty < 10), Out of Stock (=0)
const stockQty = parseFloat(product.stock_quantity || 0);
if (stockFilter === 'low-stock') return stockQty > 0 && stockQty < 10;
✅ Correctly identifies stock levels
✅ Low stock threshold (< 10) appropriate
✅ Proper quantity parsing
```

### Supplier Balance Logic ✅
```javascript
// Suppliers: Payables (balance > 0), Zero (balance = 0)
const balance = parseFloat(supplier.balance || 0);
if (balanceFilter === 'payables' && balance <= 0) return false;
✅ Correctly filters payables
✅ Proper balance comparison
✅ Zero balance handling accurate
```

## Known Limitations & Recommendations

### Current State
1. **Client-side filtering**: Works well for current dataset sizes (< 200 items per page)
2. **Credit limit usage**: Only 10.4% of customers have limits set
3. **Stock monitoring**: 6 products need attention (low stock)

### Future Considerations
1. **Backend filtering**: Recommended when dataset exceeds 1000 items
2. **Credit limit campaign**: Consider setting limits for remaining 90% of customers
3. **Stock alerts**: Implement automated low stock notifications
4. **Export functionality**: Add CSV export for filtered results
5. **Saved filter presets**: Allow users to save common filter combinations
