## Technical Details

### State Management
All filters use `usePersistentState` hook:
```javascript
const [filter, setFilter] = usePersistentState('page_filterName', defaultValue);
```
- Automatic localStorage persistence
- Survives page navigation
- No backend calls needed

### Filter Logic Pattern
```javascript
const getFilteredItems = () => {
  return items.filter(item => {
    // Layer 1: Search
    if (!matchesSearch) return false;
    
    // Layer 2: Status/Category
    if (!matchesStatus) return false;
    
    // Layer 3: Range
    if (!matchesRange) return false;
    
    return true;
  });
};
```

### Pagination Pattern
```javascript
const paginated = itemsPerPage === 'all' 
  ? filteredItems 
  : filteredItems.slice((page - 1) * itemsPerPage, page * itemsPerPage);
```
