## ✅ COMPLETED: Full-Screen Supplier History with All Columns

### Issue Resolution

  - For payments: Shows "-" (no method field in current schema)
- ✅ **Debit**: Purchase amounts (red)
- ✅ **Credit**: Payment amounts (green)
- ✅ **Balance**: Running balance with Dr/Cr indicator

#### 3. **Data Accuracy & Display**

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### Backend Changes (`suppliersController.js`)
```javascript
// Enhanced purchase query with all fields
SELECT id, date, total_cost as amount, 'purchase' as type, date as created_at,
       description, supplier_invoice_id, delivery_method
FROM purchases WHERE supplier_id = ?

// Fixed payment query (only existing columns)
SELECT id, date, amount, 'payment' as type, date as created_at,
       'Payment to supplier' as description
FROM payments WHERE supplier_id = ?
```

#### Frontend Changes (`Suppliers.js`)
- **Full-screen modal**: 1200px wide, 95vw max, 90vh height
- **Column layout**: Optimized widths for all data
- **Responsive table**: Horizontal scroll for narrow screens
- **Data handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing fields (`|| '-'`)
