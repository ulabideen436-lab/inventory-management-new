# Supplier Ledger Full-Screen Display with All Columns

## Summary

Enhanced the supplier ledger history display to show all purchase and payment attributes in separate columns, ensuring complete visibility of transaction details.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (`backend/src/controllers/suppliersController.js`)

#### Purchase Query Enhancement
- **Line 127-132**: Added `description`, `supplier_invoice_id`, and `delivery_method` fields to the purchase query
```javascript
SELECT id, date, total_cost as amount, 'purchase' as type, date as created_at,
       description, supplier_invoice_id, delivery_method
FROM purchases 
WHERE supplier_id = ? 
ORDER BY date ASC
```

#### Payment Query Enhancement
- **Line 164-169**: Added `payment_method` and `reference_number` fields to the payment query
```javascript
SELECT id, date, amount, 'payment' as type, date as created_at,
       COALESCE(description, 'Payment to supplier') as description,
       payment_method, reference_number
FROM payments 
WHERE supplier_id = ? 
ORDER BY date ASC
```

#### Description Logic Update
- **Line 136-155**: Updated description handling to preserve original purchase descriptions
- Only generates description from items if no description exists
- Keeps `supplier_invoice_id` and `delivery_method` intact

### 2. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/Suppliers.js`)

#### Table Header Update
- **Line 1960-2015**: Added two new columns to the ledger table:
  - **Invoice/Ref#**: Shows `supplier_invoice_id` for purchases, `reference_number` for payments
  - **Method**: Shows `delivery_method` for purchases, `payment_method` for payments

#### Column Widths Adjusted
- Date: 8%
- Trans#: 6%
- DOC: 6%
- Description: 20% (reduced from 40%)
- Invoice/Ref#: 10% (NEW)
- Method: 10% (NEW)
- Debit: 10%
- Credit: 10%
- Balance: 10%

#### Table Body Update
- **Line 2078-2105**: Added two new `<td>` cells for each transaction row:
  - Invoice/Ref# cell: Displays appropriate field based on transaction type
  - Method cell: Displays delivery or payment method

### 3. Purchase Editor Fixes

#### Backend GET `/purchases/:id`
- **purchasesController.js Line 108-115**: Enhanced response to include:
  - `description`
  - `supplier_invoice_id`
  - `delivery_method`
  - Changed `date` from `created_at` to actual purchase `date`

#### Backend PUT `/purchases/:id`
- Already configured to accept and save: `total_cost`, `description`, `supplier_invoice_id`, `delivery_method`, `purchase_date`
- Field name fixed in frontend: Changed `date` to `purchase_date` in API request

## Testing

### Test Script: `test-purchase-edit-data.js`
