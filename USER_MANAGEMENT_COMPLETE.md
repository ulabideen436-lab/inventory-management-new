## 🔒 Security Implementation

async createUserByOwner(email, password, displayName, role) {
  const currentUser = auth.currentUser;
  const currentUserData = await this.getUserData(currentUser.uid);
  
  if (currentUserData?.role !== 'owner') {
    throw new Error('Permission denied. Only owners can create users.');
  }
  // ... create user
}
```

### **Protected Routes**
- `/owner/users` - Only accessible by owners
- Cashiers redirected to `/cashier` if they try to access

### **Firestore Security Rules**
```javascript
// Users collection
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn();
  allow create: if isSignedIn();
  allow update: if isOwner() || request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow delete: if isOwner();
}
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### **User Creation Limitation**
Firebase client SDK does not support creating users while another user is authenticated.

**Current Behavior:**
- Form creates user profile in Firestore
- **Does NOT create Firebase Auth account**
- Manual step required in Firebase Console

**Manual Steps After Creating User:**
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Users
2. Click "Add User"
3. Enter the same email and password
4. User can now log in with the role assigned in Firestore

### **Production Solution Required**
For production, implement one of these:

1. **Firebase Cloud Functions** (Recommended)
   - Use Admin SDK to create users
   - Server-side user creation
   - See `USER_CREATION_GUIDE.md`

2. **Invitation System**
   - Send invite links
   - User signs up with invitation code
   - Role auto-assigned from invitation

3. **Manual Creation** (Current)
   - Create in Firebase Console
   - Set role in Firestore
