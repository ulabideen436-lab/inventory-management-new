# Menu Bar Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified
The menu bar was displaying placeholder text "// ...existing code..." between "Reports" and "Transactions" items.

## Root Cause
Placeholder comments `// ...existing code...` were left in the JSX code in `OwnerDashboard.js` file during previous edits.

## Files Fixed
- `frontend/src/pages/OwnerDashboard.js`

## Changes Made
1. **Navigation Links Section**: Removed placeholder comment between Reports and Transactions links
2. **Routes Section**: Removed placeholder comment between Reports and Transactions routes  
3. **Imports Section**: Removed placeholder comment in import statements

## Result
The menu bar should now display correctly without any placeholder text:
```
Owner POS | Products | Sales | Customers | Suppliers | Reports | Transactions
```

## Technical Details
- The issue was caused by JSX treating the comment as renderable content
- Comments inside JSX return statements can sometimes be rendered as text
- Proper cleanup of placeholder comments is essential for clean UI

## Prevention
- Always use proper JSX comment syntax: `{/* comment */}` instead of `// comment` in JSX
- Remove all placeholder text before committing code
- Test UI after editing JSX files to ensure no artifacts remain
